# LeaderboardDB

A structured repository dedicated to collecting, preserving, and analysing every publicly visible account on [WWW KoGaMa](https://www.kogama.com). Its purpose is to identify indicators of automated activity, coordinated boosting, harassment patterns, and usernames that violate platform standards.  
Flagged accounts are stored to support investigation, reporting, and long-term monitoring.

## Overview

This project performs a broad, methodical scrape of KoGaMa’s leaderboard. The intention is to build a traceable, auditable dataset rather than perfect code. The focus lies on recognising patterns such as:

- Automated or scripted behaviour  
- Experience or economy boosting chains  
- Suspicious purchasing paths involving avatars or models  
- Inappropriate or offensive usernames  
- Accounts repurposed for advertising unauthorised files or services  

Completeness and reproducibility outrank elegance, ensuring that all retrieved data remains intact for later evaluation.

## API Method

Scraping is performed through the public leaderboard endpoint: ``api/leaderboard/top/``  
Since the endpoint enforces a maximum ``count`` of ``400`` per page, the process relies on sequential pagination. Each page is written to disk immediately for safety and later processing.

Request format:  
``{ENDPOINT}?count={COUNT}&page={PAGE}``    

**Special Credits to __Zpayer__** as it is a project only possible thanks to his original code of [KoGaMaSearch](https://github.com/RandomUser15456/KoGaMa-Search)    
Initial scrape launched: **November 16th, 3:42 AM**.

## Catalogue Structure

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/Bots`
A dedicated directory for accounts confirmed to display traits associated with automated or exploitative activity. These commonly include mid-range boosted levels (approximately 8–22) and behaviours such as:

- Purchasing assets to benefit a primary account  
- Interacting in patterns consistent with market manipulation  
- Machine-like activity repetition  
- External or inappropriate promotional links in profile fields  

This folder acts as a consolidated reference for reporting and reviewing suspicious account clusters.   

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/Inappropriate`
A focused directory for accounts flagged by the automated username-content screening system. These entries typically include indicators such as:

- Detected slurs, discriminatory phrasing, or derogatory constructions  
- Obfuscated or stylistically altered forms of offensive language  
- Usernames crafted to evade standard filters while preserving harmful intent  
- Embedded references that fall under prohibited or sensitive categories  

This folder serves as a structured archive for reviewing, documenting, and reporting profiles whose naming patterns violate community standards or present clear moderation concerns.   

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/SequentialAccs`
A classification directory for accounts whose usernames consist primarily of raw numeric sequences. These profiles are not inherently bot-linked but commonly exhibit traits such as:

- Usernames formed exclusively from uninterrupted digit strings  
- Minimal semantic structure, suggesting autogenerated or placeholder naming  
- Patterns resembling bulk-created or low-effort registrations  
- Limited contextual value for behavioural analysis beyond structural noise  

This collection functions as an organized repository for tracking and filtering numerically-titled accounts that add negligible relevance to broader leaderboard behaviour studies.

## Notes

For those with access: quality of code is not the objective. Only the outcome and the integrity of the dataset are.
