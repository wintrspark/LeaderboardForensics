# LeaderboardDB

A structured repository dedicated to indexing and analysing every publicly visible account on KoGaMa. Its purpose is to identify indicators of automated activity, coordinated boosting, harassment patterns, and usernames that violate platform standards.  
Flagged accounts are stored to support investigation, reporting, and long-term monitoring.

---

## Overview

This project performs a broad, methodical scrape of KoGaMa’s leaderboard. The intention is to build a traceable, auditable dataset rather than perfect code. The focus lies on recognising patterns such as:

- Automated or scripted behaviour  
- Experience or economy boosting chains  
- Suspicious purchasing paths involving avatars or models  
- Inappropriate or offensive usernames  
- Accounts repurposed for advertising unauthorised files or services  

Completeness and reproducibility outrank elegance, ensuring that all retrieved data remains intact for later evaluation.

## API Method

Scraping is performed through the public leaderboard endpoint:  
``api/leaderboard/top/``  

Since the endpoint enforces a maximum ``count`` of ``400`` per page, the process relies on sequential pagination. Each page is written to disk immediately for safety and later processing.

Request format:  
``{ENDPOINT}?count={COUNT}&page={PAGE}``

**Special Credits to __Zpayer__**, as the project is only possible thanks to his original work on [KoGaMaSearch](https://github.com/RandomUser15456/KoGaMa-Search).  
Initial scrape launched: **November 16th, 3:42 AM**.

## Catalogue Structure

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/Bots`
A dedicated directory for accounts confirmed to display traits associated with automated or exploitative activity. These commonly include mid-range boosted levels (approximately 8–22) and behaviours such as:

- Purchasing assets to benefit a primary account  
- Interacting in patterns consistent with market manipulation  
- Machine-like activity repetition  
- External or inappropriate promotional links in profile fields  

This folder acts as a consolidated reference for reporting and reviewing suspicious account clusters.

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/Inappropriate`
A focused directory for accounts flagged by the automated username-content screening system. These entries typically include indicators such as:

- Detected slurs, discriminatory phrasing, or derogatory constructions  
- Obfuscated or stylised forms of offensive language  
- Usernames crafted to evade standard filters while preserving harmful intent  
- Embedded references falling under prohibited or sensitive categories  

This folder serves as a structured archive for reviewing, documenting, and reporting profiles whose naming patterns violate community standards.

### `LeaderboardDB/Hits/SequentialAccs`
A classification directory for accounts whose usernames consist primarily of raw numeric sequences. These profiles are not inherently bot-linked but commonly exhibit traits such as:

- Usernames formed exclusively from uninterrupted digit strings  
- Minimal semantic structure, suggesting autogenerated or placeholder naming  
- Patterns resembling bulk-created or low-effort registrations  
- Limited contextual value beyond structural noise  

This collection functions as an organised repository for filtering numerically-titled accounts that add negligible relevance to broader behavioural studies.

## Scripts


#### **Note:**  
> The filtering system has been refined and rewritten multiple times throughout the project’s development. While the tools aim for high reliability, **complete accuracy in detecting bot-like behaviour or inappropriate usernames cannot be guaranteed**. All results should be treated as indicators, not definitive classifications.

### `Scripts/Filters/seq.py`
A specialised utility responsible for identifying and grouping accounts whose usernames are formed from pure or near-pure numeric sequences.  
It acts as the primary classifier for entries destined for `SequentialAccs`.

### `Scripts/Filters/slur.py`
The principal filtering engine for inappropriate usernames.  
Designed to detect prohibited phrasing, obfuscations, stylised bypasses, deliberate spacing, numeral substitution, and other methods used to disguise offensive language.

### `Scripts/Filters/mainfilter.py`
The main heuristic filter underpinning bot-pattern recognition.  
It correlates recurring structures, prefix patterns, model purchase behaviour, and other indicators characteristic of coordinated or automated accounts.  
This script produces the final categorisation for entries moved into `Bots`.

### `Scripts/Scrape/main.py`
The central scraping tool responsible for collecting leaderboard data from the selected server.  
It handles sequential pagination, local storage of retrieved pages, and ensures the continuity and reliability of the scraping process.

## Notes

- Scraped data will **not** be published, mirrored, or externally backed up. This decision is based on privacy considerations, legal boundaries, and unnecessary storage overhead.  
- Code quality is not the objective, only the outcome and integrity of the dataset matter.

## Credits

- **Zpayer** – Author of the original scraping approach implemented in Node.js. This project adapts that foundation into Python to broaden accessibility, even if performance differs.   
- **EJota** – Primary and almost-direct channel to report flagged accounts, huge help during the entire project.
